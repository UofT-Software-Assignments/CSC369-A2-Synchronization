/* Hungry, hungry hippos! There are "players" hippos (4, in the board game, but 
 * we can * imagine more). A referee dumps a handful of marbles ("total_marbles" 
 * of them) between the hippos, and the hippos attempt to consume marbles as 
 * quickly as possible. 
 * However, each hippo can only consume one marble at a time. When all of the 
 * marbles have been consumed, the hippo who ate the last marble informs the 
 * referee, who prints the score for that round and then dumps "total_marbles" 
 * more marbles onto the board. This game repeats for a fixed number of "rounds".
 *
 * The basic algorithm for the game is given below, but some of the synchronization
 * is missing. Fill in the appropriate synchronization and any 
 * conditionals (if-statements) required to protect the global data. 
 *
 * In particular, you will need to solve the following synchronization problems:
 * 1. The referee needs to know when there are no more marbles (a game is done) 
 *    and can call restart_game (Make sure that all threads waiting on a condition 
 *    variable at this point can proceed.)
 * 2. When all the rounds are done, the referee needs to ensure that all threads
 *    that are wating on a condition variable wake up and can exit. You will need
 *    to add a bit more logic, so that had hippo waiting on out_of_marbles 
 *    will be awakened and can return from the function when rounds is 0.
 * 
 * The necessary variables including locks and condition variables are given 
 * to you and initialized.
 *
